From a young age, I’ve loved the way music can bring out different emotions and make me feel better. Singing along to my favorite songs or just playing the guitar helps me feel peaceful and calm, especially when life gets stressful. Whenever I’m playing or singing, I can forget about everything else and just focus on the music. It’s a way for me to express my thoughts and feelings without using words. Music brings me comfort, and it’s a big part of who I am. It’s something I turn to whenever I need to relax or find a moment of joy.
