				<th class="th4" style="font-weight: lighter; border: 5px cadetblue solid;"><img src="sunset.jpg" style="width: 293px; height: 150px; padding: 3px;">I loved sunsets. There’s something so special about watching the sky change from bright colors to soft shades of orange, pink, and purple. It gives me a feeling of calm and comfort, as if the world slows down for a moment. Whenever I watch the sunset, I feel like I can take a break from everything happening around me. It’s a time for me to relax, reflect on my day, and just enjoy the beauty of nature. I find it so peaceful, and it helps me clear my mind. Sunsets remind me to appreciate the little moments in life, to slow down, and to be grateful for what I have. It’s a simple, but beautiful way to feel connected to the world around me. It is a very grateful moment to end a very heavy and exhausting day. </th>
